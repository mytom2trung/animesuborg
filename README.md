<h2>Motivation</h2>
Before I learned HTML/CSS/Javascript to become a web developer, I'd always dreamt of creating an anime page for myself to watch without ads, which drove me to learn the necessary technology and tools required for this first "from scratch" project.

# IMPROVE
- A better way for writing these kinds of projects in the future (I haven't known React at the point of doing this project, so I really haven't used it at its best, I hope the next project will be better).
- Write a better CSS, since it's my first-hand project, I did mess up the global CSS which lead me to override a lot of CSS.
- Apply more ways and technologies needed (like Redux, useMemo, useRef, etc. for more flexibility in handling data)
- Fix bugs if it's still around, but I'm trying on other projects, so progress on this will be plodding.

# SOURCES
- This is a free project, the data is from [Vuighe](https://vuighe.net/), please support them.
- Combine with [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) data and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) for trailer provider and further information for anime.
